# Data-Acquisition Junkie & Web Developer

### I like to extend existing web technologies to data-acquisition, especially in scientific domain

Have a look at my "simple-to-use-yet-sophisticated-enough" server side data-acquisition/IoT runtime [hololinked](https://github.com/VigneshVSV/hololinked), hololinked as in "instrumentation that can be connected to the internet in a wholesome and systematic way"

Currently:
- I am working on [hololinked](https://github.com/VigneshVSV/hololinked), stabilising it & augmenting it with all the tools necessary to thoroughly carry out data-acquisition
- I am learning [W3C Web of Things](https://www.w3.org/WoT/) and Semantic Web and pondering on how to bring WoT to [hololinked](https://github.com/VigneshVSV/hololinked)
- Ask me anything about data-acquisition especially within scientific domain
